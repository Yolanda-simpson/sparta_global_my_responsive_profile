      <p>Can low-cost off-the-shelf embedded development kits be used to create a smart doorbell?’ This involved designing a smart doorbell by using off-the-shelf small embedded system development kits such as Arduino, small development boards and motion sensors; The aim was to create a doorbell system that will activate a camera when a button is pressed or when a motion sensor is activated. The homeowner receives a notification when someone is at their door, and they can then communicate with the visitor via an app</p>
